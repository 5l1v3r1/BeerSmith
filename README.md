These packages are the official BeerSmith2 builds
repackaged to support other Linux Distributions.

The binaries installed are the exact same as those
avaialable from beersmith.com

The tarball extracts two folders:
 etc
 usr
Copy the contents of these folders to the same
location on your system. Later this will be
automated.
